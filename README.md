According to World Health Organization, as of 2011, there are approximately 2.1 billion people who are dependent on regular medicines. Appropriate dispensing and consumption of medicines in the form of pills or tablets is a pivotal part of modern health care. In most cases, patients are advised to take multiple types of medicines, in different dosages, at different times through the day. Missed doses or incorrect intake could be potentially life threatening. The proposed system is a comprehensive solution to the issue and is designed as an interactive assistant.

Through a mobile application as the user interface, the system takes manual input of the medicines and dosages along with the time of the day at which it has to be taken as prescribed by the doctor. The dispenser automatically administers the dosage at specified time intervals and has reminder and communication features.
